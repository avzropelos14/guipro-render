This project is called an appointment setter management system.

If you know the appointment setter in SSS, this project is similar to that. Where you can set an appointment with the individual an meet him on the schedule that you created.

The features are quite simple with the Edit and Delete and Logout buttons. You can choose Edit if you want to update some of the information regarding the appointment; say time, name, date, and purpose.

To run it locally on your computer, Open your Pycharm and install 'pip install Flask' if you don't have a flask yet.

Next create folder two folders named: static - folder where you will place the style.css templates - folder where you will place the html templates

Outside of those folders create a index.py where all of the functions and routes will be placed. Simply put it is the connection between all of your htmls.

After that just copy the code here and paste it on your pycharm. Thank you and Enjoy!
